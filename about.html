                    <p>
                        DENG is developed by only one person. However everyone is welcome to submit pull requests in Github.

                    <h2>How I began developing DENG?</h2>
                    <p>
                        DENG development began in August 2020. Back then I had little to no knowledge about computer graphics, especially 3D
                        graphics, since all I had really done was tinker with SFML, which is a 2D graphics library. My first goal was to 
                        create a Touhou Project like bullet hell shooter game, but without any fancy audio and magic spells. Well I kinda made
                        the game and it worked somewhat. The only problem was that the codebase was a huge unmaintainable mess of a spaghetti.
                        The source code for this incomplete messy game can be found <a href="https://github.com/inugami-dev64/project_gemu">here</a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Eventually I abondoned the project and started working on creating the game engine instead. At that time
                        I tried using the same SFML library I had used previously and I even managed to create somewhat functioning 
                        editor. The only problem was that the so called editor was limited to CLI commands and 2D graphics only. 
                        Then I discovered the magic of Vulkan. As it might be known, Vulkan is not the most beginner friendly API out there.
                        Even drawing a simple triangle to the screen requires at least 1000 lines of code. Luckally there were some really 
                        good tutorials out on the internet about the Vulkan API (<a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com">one that I used for the learning</a>). <br><br>

                        Finally I started implementing my own Vulkan renderer and after about a week of tinkering with Vulkan I managed to get a
                        triangle to the screen. Once the main trouble of setting Vulkan renderer up was done I started working on DENG itself. 
                        Due to the limited knowledge about linear algebra my first implementation of first person camera system came out broken, since
                        I could not figure out for some time how to perform correct rotations around x and z-axes. Eventually I found out that my 
                        view matrix calculations were done incorrectly. In that implementation x and z rotation matrices were calculated from 
                        y rotation using following formulas: x_rot = cos(y_rot); z_rot = -sin(y_rot) and then rotation matrices were multiplied with 
                        camera transformation matrix. All I needed to do was just to perform rotation matrix multiplications on camera up/right/forward 
                        side vectors and then add them to the transformation matrix, which also was the view matrix.
